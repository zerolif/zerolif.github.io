		<blockquote>
        	        <cite>DAVID WALTER</br><em>Little Black Dress UK</em></cite>
        		<q>A cool, sophisticated lady with oodles of energy. On fire 24/7 firing your brand to all the seasoned and  wannabe players in a world she owns.</q>

        <blockquote>
        	        <cite>JOHN PRITCHARD</br><em>Founder of PALA Eyewear</em></cite>
                <q>As an eyewear brand emerging into a highly competitive market it’s really important for us that we make a good deal of noise with the media. Amanda works incredibly hard to ensure we achieve this and clearly has a great relationship with her contacts that has afforded us some great PR opportunities in both the UK and around the world.</q>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

                    <cite>CHARLOTTE DOUCY</br><em>Brand Manager for Le Mystere</em></cite>
                <q>We worked with Amanda on one of our lingerie brands, Le Mystere. She was extremely easy to work with, enthusiastic about the brand, and made every effort to ensure that we were put forward for all appropriate coverage. If the opportunity arose we would undoubtedly work with her again.</q>
